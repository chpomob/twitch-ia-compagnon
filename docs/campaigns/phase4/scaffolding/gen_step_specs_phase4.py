"""Generate per-step loop specs (Pn-spec.md) for PHASE 4 from the approved plan.

Durable copy: this script and its output live INSIDE the repository
(`docs/campaigns/phase4/scaffolding/`) so a reboot or a /tmp wipe cannot destroy the campaign
scaffolding (2026-09-16: a reboot erased /tmp and the whole runner + step specs with it).

Mechanical extraction — no rewriting: each step spec carries the plan's own
Files/Description/Dependencies/Tests/Risks text plus the spec's R/AC references, and the loop
constraints (test command, atomic commit, no weakened tests).

Root-document guard: a step may list the repository-root `spec.md` or `plan.md` as a target. Those
are the historical v1-MVP documents. Every root-document target is rewritten to the phase-4 archive
under `docs/campaigns/phase4/`, with an explicit do-not-overwrite note.

Plan step `{sid}` of the approved Phase 4 plan for `twitch-ia-compagnon`.
Authority documents (read them, do not re-derive):
- Approved plan (this step is the whole scope, nothing more): `docs/campaigns/phase4/plan.md`
- Approved specification (requirement and acceptance-criteria wording): `docs/campaigns/phase4/spec.md`
- Brief with the operator's binding decisions: `docs/campaigns/phase4/brief.md`
- Approved v2 design (rationale): `docs/design-v2.md`
Repository: `{REPO}` (Python, asyncio, event-bus core + modules). Working tree at `main`.

## Problem

{desc}

## Requirements

Plan mapping: {reqs}
Acceptance criteria owned by this step: {acs}
Read the exact R/AC text in the specification file before writing code. Requirements not listed
here are other steps' responsibility — do not implement them.

{STANDING_DECISIONS}
## Files

{guarded}{guard_note}

Touch ONLY these files. Creating a listed file that does not exist yet is part of the step.
If you believe another file must change, stop and report it instead of editing it.

## Dependencies

{deps}

All dependencies are already merged into `main` when this step runs.

## Tests

{tests}

Test command (must pass): `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q -p no:cacheprovider`
Always use the project virtualenv: the SYSTEM python lacks `aiohttp`, which the proxy and the
two-process topology tests import — a `python3 -m pytest` run fails at collection there.
Every acceptance criterion this step owns must be enforced by a test that fails without the
change. Never weaken, skip, xfail or delete an existing assertion to make the suite pass; if an
existing test encodes a superseded guarantee, replace it and cite the superseding requirement in
the test docstring. Do not use positive-duration sleeps in tests — inject the clock, the RNG and
the transports. The suite must not drop below 2,460 passed / 18 skipped.

## Risks

{risks}

## Constraints

- One atomic commit for the whole step when the suite is green; Conventional Commit message
  (`feat(phase4): ...`, `fix(phase4): ...`, `test(phase4): ...`, `refactor(phase4): ...`, `docs(phase4): ...`).
  The scope MUST be `phase4`: the repository history is full of `feat(phase3):` / `fix(phase2):` commits
  from earlier phases — do NOT copy that habit. Every commit this campaign makes is `(phase4)`.
- Keep the phase-0 to phase-3 guarantees in force: bounded admission, phase lifecycle, explicit
  terminal action outcomes, default-deny authorization (reads included), bounded retention, a single
  global startup/shutdown cleanup deadline, redaction of configured secrets in traces and loss
  diagnostics, and the phase-3 moderation/memory/watch semantics.
- No module name may be added to `core/main.py` — a new module starts and stops through its manifest.
- Platform neutrality: contracts and brain must not depend on a specific platform; a second fake
  platform exercises the same contracts.
- A secret VALUE must never reach a response, a log line or a diagnostic — only its reference and its
  set/unset state.
- No new runtime dependency; no model, provider or vendor name in code, config or commit messages.
- Report at the end: what changed, the exact test command output count, and anything you could
  not do because the plan did not cover it.
