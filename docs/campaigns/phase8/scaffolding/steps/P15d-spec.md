# Step P15d — AC33 conversion

Plan step `P15d` of the approved Phase 8 plan for `twitch-ia-compagnon`.
Authority documents (read them, do not re-derive):
- Approved plan (this step is the whole scope, nothing more): `docs/campaigns/phase8/plan.md`
- Approved specification (requirement and acceptance-criteria wording): `docs/campaigns/phase8/spec.md`
- Brief with the operator's binding decisions: `docs/campaigns/phase8/brief.md`
- Approved v2 design (rationale, and the trust model the guard implements): `docs/design-v2.md`
Repository: `/media/chpo/HDD-papa/twitch-ia-compagnon` (Python, asyncio, event-bus core + modules). Working tree at `main`.

## Problem

`FakeInstance` (`tests/test_automation_bridge.py:940-990`) serves a loopback
  `web.TCPSite`. It is rebuilt on `MemoryWebSocketPair` (`tests/conftest.py:2073`). Each connect
  attempt hands the module one `client` end and runs `FakeInstance._handle` on the `server` end. The
  connection, disconnection, held-acknowledgement and withheld-inventory behaviour is unchanged.
  The streamerbot module creates its own `aiohttp.ClientSession()`
  (`modules/streamerbot/__init__.py:2318`), so a fixture monkeypatches `aiohttp.ClientSession` with a
  session whose `ws_connect(url)` asks the matching `FakeInstance` for a pair. That is a dependency
  patch, not the subject: no production change, and no new seam in streamerbot. Refused connections
  (instance stopped) raise `aiohttp.ClientConnectorError`. `url` stays a nominal
  `ws://127.0.0.1:<n>/` so the URL assertions hold. The 78 nodes leave `AC33_PENDING`.

## Requirements

Plan mapping: R9
Acceptance criteria owned by this step: AC33, AC33
Read the exact R/AC text in the specification file before writing code. Requirements not listed
here are other steps' responsibility — do not implement them.

Standing phase-8 decisions that override any contrary reading of a requirement:
- **A module declares its trigger types; the kernel evaluates them.** The four generic types
  (`probability`, `audience`, `keyword`, `event_kind`) stay and remain usable by any input. A declared
  type carries a declarative match rule; no module code runs in the hot path for it.
- **A declared type narrows, never widens, and grants nothing.** Configuration is validated against the
  module's declared schema *and* the kernel's canonical one. A type cannot assert a field its input
  does not emit, and a trigger only decides candidacy: admission, budgets and DEFAULT-DENY are
  untouched and still decide everything after it.
- **The one hook is bounded and fail-closed.** It runs only on events its own module emitted, under a
  hard timeout; raising or exceeding the bound means *no trigger*, never a silent pass, and its outcome
  is recorded like every other decision.
- **Event kinds are appended, never reordered.** `reward` and `manual` join the closed vocabulary at the
  end, the way `cue` did; earlier indices keep their order and meaning.
- **No new runtime dependency.** `aiohttp` and `PyYAML` remain the only ones. The wake-word detector is
  configured (a command or an HTTP endpoint), exactly like an audio source or the transcription
  endpoint; a detector is never embedded and never assumed.
- **Streamer.bot stays optional.** Its `cue` path is unchanged, and nothing in this phase needs it.
- **No continuous listening.** Audio publishes an event only when a trigger or a run asked for it; a
  run that nobody requested must not record audio, and continuous transcription is out of scope.
- **No test opens a socket.** Twitch, the detector, the surfaces and the audio device are faked; the
  real-instance trial stays a documented manual procedure with its own record.
- Close exactly the requirement(s) this step names. If a sibling path shows the same defect, report
  it in your final message instead of widening the step.
- No test is skipped, xfailed, deleted or loosened. The full suite is green at every step:
  `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q -p no:cacheprovider` (never the system python: no aiohttp).

## Files

[`tests/test_automation_bridge.py`, `tests/conftest.py`]

Touch ONLY these files. Creating a listed file that does not exist yet is part of the step.
If you believe another file must change, stop and report it instead of editing it.

## Dependencies

[P15c]

All dependencies are already merged into `main` when this step runs.

## Tests

All 78 nodes pass under the guard with their assertions kept. A new check confirms the
  module's `_writer` probe (`modules/streamerbot/__init__.py:2200`, a `getattr` with a default) still
  sees a live connection on `MemoryWebSocket`. A dropped pair (`drop`, close code 1006) still drives
  the reconnect path.

Test command (must pass): `.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q -p no:cacheprovider`
Always use the project virtualenv: the SYSTEM python lacks `aiohttp`, which the proxy and the
two-process topology tests import — a `python3 -m pytest` run fails at collection there.
Every acceptance criterion this step owns must be enforced by a test that fails without the
change. Never weaken, skip, xfail or delete an existing assertion to make the suite pass; if an
existing test encodes a superseded guarantee, replace it and cite the superseding requirement in
the test docstring. Do not use positive-duration sleeps in tests — inject the clock, the RNG and
the transports. The suite must not drop below 3,124 passed / 18 skipped, the count at the start of
this phase; the seven allowlisted tests are adapted as the specification lists them, never weakened.

## Risks

`MemoryWebSocket` must offer every method the module calls on a client socket. The step
  lists them with `grep` over `modules/streamerbot/__init__.py` and adds any that are missing
  (`ping`, `exception`) to `MemoryWebSocket`, with its own test. Timing tests that relied on real I/O
  scheduling may need the ManualClock; a test whose assertion would have to change for that is
  flagged, not loosened.

## Constraints

- One atomic commit for the whole step when the suite is green; Conventional Commit message
  (`feat(phase8): ...`, `fix(phase8): ...`, `test(phase8): ...`, `refactor(phase8): ...`, `docs(phase8): ...`).
  The scope MUST be `phase8`: the repository history is full of `feat(phase4):` / `fix(phase3):` commits
  from earlier phases — do NOT copy that habit. Every commit this campaign makes is `(phase8)`.
- Keep the phase-0 to phase-4 guarantees in force: bounded admission, phase lifecycle, explicit
  terminal action outcomes, default-deny authorization (reads included), bounded retention, a single
  global startup/shutdown cleanup deadline, redaction of configured secrets in traces and loss
  diagnostics, the phase-3 moderation/memory/watch semantics, and the phase-4 configuration UI's
  local-only, read-only-for-secrets-and-actions surface.
- No module name may be added to `core/main.py` — a new module starts and stops through its manifest.
- Platform neutrality: contracts and brain must not depend on a specific platform; a second fake
  platform exercises the same contracts.
- A secret VALUE must never reach a response, a log line or a diagnostic — only its reference and its
  set/unset state.
- No new runtime dependency (aiohttp and PyYAML only); no model, provider or vendor name in code,
  config or commit messages.
- Report at the end: what changed, the exact test command output count, and anything you could
  not do because the plan did not cover it.
